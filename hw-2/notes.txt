Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
* Given a word in context
* A fixed inventory of potential word senses
Goal: We want to decide which sense of the word our input word is.


Aside:
For this assignment our WSD task is a lexical sample task:
- Select a very small pre-selected set of target words (e.g. line, plant)
  - Store the senses for each of these words.


Classification- use Naive Bayes
* Input:
    - word w and some features f
    - fixed set of classes C={c1, c2, ..., cj}
* Output: predicted class c that exists in C.


* Implementation:
    * DONE-step 0: Get a word pair (i.e. [night, seat]) and replace the first instance of
either word with the pseudoword (i.e. nightseat for [night, seat]).
    * step 0.5: Pre-process words in the amazon_reviews.txt file, save each line as a list.
    * DONE-step 1: For each line, extract a window of +/- 10 words around the target word.

    For later:
        - 80% of the lines should be used for training.
            - For training, create two files: night_training.txt & seat_training.txt

        - 20% will be used for testing.
            - For testing, create two files: night_testing.txt & seat_testing.txt
            These will contain the contexts surrounding the words chosen.

    * DONE-step 2: Create pseudowords. For each line in the review, replace ONLY the
FIRST INSTANCE of either word, then move on to the next word.
For each replacement, record the line # and original word in a truth file,
this may end up not being necessary.

    * step 3: Calculate the probabilities for each of the two senses for each pseudoword.
Using the already-defined window size, calculate the frequencies of each word seen in the
window around each psuedoword occurence. These words are the context features.

    * step 4: Test time! Use the 20% of the contexts reserved for testing, to disambiguate 
the pseudowords.

----- Write the below steps in the report-----

    * step 5: Evaluation Time! For each sense, determine whether the identified sense is 
correct or not. You can do this in an excel spreadsheet most easily, 
or in your own program, or by hand. 
What was the accuracy of your disambiguation for each pseudoword?

    * step 6: Analysis Time!
      - How accurate is the algorithm on the words with distinct meanings 
vs with the words that occur in similar contexts? 

(Optional-Bonus) Do the same experiment using a contexts of different sizes and/or 
more and less labeled dates. Is it more or less accurate?
